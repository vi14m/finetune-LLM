# Finetune-LLM 🧠

A minimal starter project for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using Google Colab.

## 🚀 Overview

This repo provides a simple and reproducible setup for training and evaluating LLMs with minimal dependencies. Ideal for quick experiments, prototyping, or educational purposes.

## 📁 Files

- `finetuned_LLM.ipynb` – Main notebook for uploading datasets, selecting base models, and fine-tuning.
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions.

## ✅ Features

- Google Colab-compatible setup
- Lightweight and adaptable
- Easy integration with Hugging Face Transformers
- Customize training parameters and tokenizer settings

## 🛠️ Requirements

The notebook installs necessary libraries automatically, including:
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `peft` (if using parameter-efficient fine-tuning)

## 🧪 Usage

1. Open `finetuned_LLM.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload or specify your training dataset.
3. Choose your base model (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`, `gpt2`).
4. Fine-tune, evaluate, and save the resulting model.

## 📌 Notes

- Supports parameter-efficient tuning for rapid iteration.
- Preconfigured for Hugging Face-compatible models.
